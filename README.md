# I2S-Audio-Processing-Microcontroller
In this project I use the ESP32 to perform a real-time spectrum analyzer. It processes audio signals from an ADC/DAC I2S module, visualizing frequency bands via an interactive web interface.

The motivation behind this project is to control a public fountain with music, allowing water jets and lights to respond dynamically to each frequency band.

The final code of this project is [i2sFFTWebpage](src/i2sFFTWebpage.cpp). In this report I'll try to explain the main concepts of it, but there will be minor improvements that I won't refer to.

## Motivation
The desire to merge technology with art and create a visually and auditorily dynamic public space drove the development of this project. The idea of making water jets and lights in a fountain react to music in real-time presents an exciting challenge and a beautiful way to interact with sound in a physical environment.

## Features
- Real-time audio spectrum analysis using FFT.
- Dynamic visual and physical response through a web interface.
- Control over a public fountain's water jets and lights based on the music's frequency bands.
