# I2S-Audio-Processing-Microcontroller
In this project I use the ESP32 to perform a real-time spectrum analyzer. It processes audio signals from an ADC/DAC I2S module, visualizing frequency bands via an interactive web interface.

The motivation behind this project is to control a public fountain with music, allowing water jets and lights to respond dynamically to each frequency band.

The final code of this project is [i2sFFTWebpage](src/i2sFFTWebpage.cpp).
